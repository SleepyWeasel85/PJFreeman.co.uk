<h1>Phil J Freeman</h1>
<p>I did ok at school, but didn't really know what direction to take. My wise old&nbsp;mum told me to "get a trade"...</p>
<p>I joined Rolls Royce in 2001 as a Fitting Apprentice and&nbsp;spent 6 years on the shop floor building the worlds finest 
Aero Engines. During this time I met some incredibly smart and driven people who helped broaden my horizons and begin to wonder 
what more I might have to offer the world.</p>
<p>I found a step forward in a new job in the Engineering design offices&nbsp;designing the next generation of the worlds finest 
Aero Engines.&nbsp;I spent the next 6 years as a Design Engineer whilst completing my Computer Science degree part-time.</p>
<p>Today, I work for Rolls Royce&nbsp;Data Services as a Technical Architect helping deliver Engine Health Monitoring to the 
worlds finest Aero Engines</p>

<h2>Work History</h2>
<h3>2015 - Present: Technical Architect</h3>
<p>Working as the technical architect for the VisiumLAB team, I am responsible for innovating new methods and tools to provide 
value to customers through RR&rsquo;s Data Services. I work with Analysts and business stakeholders to provide VisiumLAB 
projects with technical guidance to better integrate solutions into the wider RR environment in line with future IT strategy.</p>

<h3>2012 - 2015: Pipe &amp; Harness Designer</h3>
<p>As part of the Externals Routing team, my key deliverables were design packages containing Externals dressings for Civil Large 
Engines. The role built upon my prior experience of practical build environments to enable me to produce robust external hardware 
design packages that were fit for purpose and cost efficient whilst under constant pressure to deliver to tight deadlines. This 
role has broadened my communication skills and increased my awareness of the company&rsquo;s design, manufacture and build 
process.</p>

<h3>2007 - 2012: Product Structure Controller</h3>
<p>Working as a PSC for the Installations &amp; Controls (I&amp;C) department I was responsible for the management and maintenance 
of Digital Pre-Assembly data. The role supports Production and Development capabilities of Trent 900, 1000 and XWB engines 
covering both Airbus and Boeing projects. Since joining the team, I have grown from being a team member with shared responsibility, 
to being the sole PSC responsible for the support of the Trent 1000 Fleet design activities. I then worked in the I&amp;C 
Centre of Competence supporting the design of new technologies across multiple test vehicles and Engine Projects.</p>

<h3>2004 - 2007: Engine Assembly Technician</h3>
<p>Following successful completion of my Apprenticeship I took up a permanent position on the assembly team for the V2500 
aero-engine. I established myself as a highly skilled engine fitter and worked as part of this team for 2 years. During that 
time I completed my ETOPS accreditation and became a fully qualified engine fitter. When the opportunity arose I volunteered to 
join the assembly team working on the brand new Trent 900 engine where I was again involved in all aspects of final engine 
assembly.</p>

<h2>Career Experience</h2>
<h3>Skills and interests</h3>
<p>In my current position within Data Services for Rolls Royce Plc. I am responsible for delivering innovative new methods and 
tools to provide value to internal and external customers through RR&rsquo;s Data Services. I support Analysts in delivering 
analytics to the live products and services which Rolls Royce delivers to its customers. I engage with business stakeholders 
and provide technical knowledge to ensure that project created by the VisiumLAB integrate with the wider RR environment and 
support the realization of the future IT strategy. This role requires me to perform detailed studies of available technologies 
and analyse their potential impact on the business. It also requires that I share my expertise with fellow team members and act
as an advocate for change in both technology use and methods of development and deployment.</p>

<p>During my University studies I developed skills in a range of IT disciplines and platforms. Core skills and abilities, such 
as programming and database building were combined with the more abstract theories that underpin that knowledge, such as Application 
architecture and Database design. Further to this, I established an understanding of the significance of corporate Information 
Security and the requirements set out in British and International data security standards. My key area of interest in my studies 
was Human Computer Interaction. HCI and User Interface Design are subjects I find fascinating. What particularly excites me is 
the opportunity HCI presents to remove the boundaries between IT and the countless environments that can be improved through the
correct application of Software and Hardware.</p>

<p>In my former role in the Engineering Design community I am recognized as an IT authority. This is reflected in my informal 
role of responsibility for the 3D projection suite and the hardware it utilizes as well as the formal role of Senior Computer 
Security Representative (SCSR) for the SAP software suite. In my day to day working activities I use 3D CAD software (UG NX) 
and a DBM (TeamCentre) to create accurate 3D geometry that reflects real world items such as Pipes, Brackets and Electrical 
Harnesses. This routinely involves the use of Engineering Specifications and Standards and customer requirement documents which 
all must be considered when producing work of a suitable quality to pass the Engineering review gates.</p>

<p>In another former role I was a PSC, one of my core responsibilities is to maintain the data integrity of the departments design
assemblies within TeamCentre. This requires me to hold administrator level access to TeamCentre data across a number of engine 
projects as sensitive information is passed securely between international Rolls Royce sites in line with export control law. 
I have experience using the companies engineering design tool NX (formerly Unigraphics) and TeamCentre Visualizer. Because of my 
expertise in these software packages, I am asked to prepare 3D geometry for design reviews and when it was announced that (then 
serving) Rolls Royce CEO, John Rishton would be conducting a visit to the I&amp;C department, I was asked to prepare some visual 
materials that could be presented during the visit. Visual inspection of design geometry was also part of my PSC remit, and I 
carried out interrogations on design schemes to check for clashes or close clearances that may pose a threat to design buy-off.</p>

<h3>General Skills</h3>
<p>Operating within my day to day role as well as maintaining my non-core responsibilities requires me to prioritize my time
and manage the expectations of my customers and meet mutually agreed deadlines. I have experience of delivering training to 
colleagues and management level individuals which also provided support to companywide process improvement policies. I have 
also acted as champion for the facilitation of local process improvement activities. My current role requires consideration 
of export control laws relating to Rolls Royce proprietary information, as well as internal information management guidelines. 
I have represented Rolls Royce at exhibitions and career events for young people.</p>

<h2>Interests &amp; Activities</h2>
<p>I have numerous passions outside the workplace. As well as IT my main passion, is food. Other interests include mountain 
biking in the rain, road cycling in the sun as well as photography and art galleries. I enjoy hiking in the Peak District and
have recently climbed the three highest Peaks in the British Isles. I look forward to opportunities to travel and experiencing 
new cultures and ways of thinking. I like to be open minded to new experiences and try new things whenever the opportunity 
presents itself.</p>
