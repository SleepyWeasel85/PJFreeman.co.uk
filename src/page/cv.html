<h1>Phil J Freeman</h1>

<p>I did ok at school, but didn't really know what direction to take. My wise old&nbsp;mum told me to "get a trade"...</p>

<p>I joined Rolls Royce in 2001 as a Fitting Apprentice and&nbsp;spent 6 years on the shop floor building the worlds finest Aero Engines. During this time I met some incredibly smart and driven people who helped broaden my horizons and begin to wonder what more I might have to offer the world.</p>

<p>I found a step forward in a new job in the Engineering design offices&nbsp;designing the next generation of the worlds finest Aero Engines.&nbsp;I spent the next 6 years as a Design Engineer whilst completing my Computer Science degree part-time.</p>

<p>Today, I work for Rolls Royce&nbsp;Data Services as a Technical Architect helping deliver Engine Health Monitoring to the worlds finest Aero Engines</p>
